Hi Reader, here are some scripts that I have created to help automate the process of content creation.

To get started, ensure that you have an n8n account available and a google account where you can request access to APIs such as Gmail and Sheets

Since these templates are already filled out, when you create a new project in N8N, you can import these SQL files and then run them. For a more detailed break down of each, import the files into N8N and they will have instructions within them.
